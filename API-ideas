UI client side
    -GET game state and win/draw/loss (GET /games/"id"/gamestate)
    -POST initalise a game (POST /games - game data in body)
    -POST square/column clicked and user - returns game state (PUT /game/turn - turn data in body)

Logic server side 
    -API return game board state in body
    -Verify that a move is legal - return error 4** if move illegal
    -Logic to alter current game state after turn taken
    -Some authorisation to check a POST's author - i.e. player = "red" is from red - return 4** forbidden i guess
    -Score keeping

Game state as JSON object?
